# Summary 
This project was all about creating a fully responsive website. This was the third main website from Skillcrush that I had to replicate as assigned. 
I had to combine everything I learn from flexbox, inserting images, social media icons, maps, and media queries.  Although this website is not
in detail, surfing through the website gives the audience an idea that the website is about camping and experience nature.

### Description/ walk-through
At first glance, the image of a woman will capture your eye. As you scroll down the home page, you will see where you can type in your name to 
sign in to the website. Once you get to the feature section, there will be logos on top of the small description. The cool part is when you
minimize the screen, it will be one column. As you widen the screen the columns become two and, once it gets to full width, there will be 
three columns and two rows. I had to use flexbox but, the outcome made the homepage that much more professional-looking. 


On the about page, you have text with fictional writing. The best part was inserting a map into the website.
Since it isn't a real business, I had to use a random location to complete this page.

The faq page is in gibberish like the rest of the website, but the focus was using the flexbox layout.
Overall, this Skillcrush project was a challenge but the outcome only prepared me for more 
advanced web responsive websites.

***** The cool effect is the green hover on the navigattion bar *****

#### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver (text-editor)

#### What I learn:
Since I had experience with the basics of HTML and CSS, that was more of a breeze. But, the challenge was fusing flexbox and media queries in order 
to create three different layouts to be cohesive to the device used.

##### Challenges to improve on
1. Flexbox is a challenge which I need to work on more.
2. Margins and Paddings


##### Solutions/solving the issue:
When trying to push my repo I wasnt able to do so even if the name matched with the repo in Github. I realized that I copied and paste push info using the https NOT the ssh. Once I switched to ssh on github, I then went into the terminal, typed ls -ls, then type rm -rf .git (should be in the listing/depending on the laptop brand), then go back into the folder that you want to make a repo....now git init (again), go back to github and copy and paste the ssh push code. You should be able to do the regular add, status, commit, and push after.
